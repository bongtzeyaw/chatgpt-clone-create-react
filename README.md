# chatgpt-clone-create-react
A Create React project that clones ChatGPT interface and calls OpenAI API. The endpoint for the API call is https://api.openai.com/v1/completions. We will use the  “text-davinci-002” model and set the maximum number of tokens to 50. We will also be using the Node.js OpenAI package, which offers simple access to the OpenAI API from Node.js.

For privacy purposes, we use the .env package to save personal key in a separate file. Please substitute the dummy API key in .env file with your own key.
